# Maxroll-Salvage-Filter
a simple browser extension, which adds a class filter to the salvage page on maxroll.gg

Its not beautiful, or even well done. Feel free to do better, i don't want to touch js anymore.

Pre-packaged extensions are listed under [Releases](https://github.com/Ziehnert/Maxroll-Salvage-Filter/releases)
