# Maxroll-Salvage-Filter
a simple browser extension, which adds a class filter to the salvage page on maxroll.com

Its not beautiful, or even well done. Feel free to do better, i don't want to touch js anymore.


## Chrome

Extension works by importing an unpacked extension.

## Firefox

Mozilla doens't support manifest.json v3 yet, so you have to manually adjust the version before loading it.
